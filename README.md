# rust_olc_pge
This is a very, VERY rough implementation of the One Lone Coder's Pixel Game Engine in the Rust language.

I am learning Rust, so this probably has many holes in it. For now, though, it works.

To use it, put the olc_engine folder in the /src/ folder in your rust project and update your cargo.toml to have the "cfg.windows" dependencies section match the cargo.toml file in this project.

There is an example main.rs that you can use to see how to implement the warped decal example Javid used in his PGE 2.0 video.
